# Image to DXF Conversion

A tool for generating DXF vectors from binary input textures.

- Add input images in the [textures](https://github.com/adamwhats/generate_dxf/tree/main/textures) folder. 
- In `generate.py` set the target DXF dimensions and drill bit diameter (`TARGET_WIDTH`, `TARGET_HEIGHT`  and `BIT_DIAMETER` constants)  
- Run `generate.py`, which will open a simple UI with instructions for use
